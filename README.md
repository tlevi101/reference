# Reference works
This repository collects all of my projects, from university and my personal projects.
## Thesis
Most important is my thesis, which is a multiplayer game with continous comminication between players (WebSockets).
Project available at this repository: [Function-wars](https://github.com/tlevi101/Function-wars)

I also deployed so it can be accessed without having to run on locally. [Site](https://function-wars.firebaseapp.com/) (The first login will be slow because the backend server is in idle if there is no activity and it takes time to wake up)

## Other projects
### Secrets
This project was a "trial task" for a job i aplied for. The orginal task was to make a API where secrets can be uploaded and can be shared, but i also made an Angular frontend for this.
